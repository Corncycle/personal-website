# personal-website

My personal webpage, built with React and packaged with webpack. The icons on the home page are from the package `react-icons`.

To run this project locally, clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory of the local copy. 

To create a development build, run `npm run build`. To create a production build, run `npm run prodbuild`. 

To serve the project on a local network while rebuilding upon file changes, run `npm run start`. To serve a build of the project from one of the build commands above, install `npm install --global serve` and run `serve dist`.
